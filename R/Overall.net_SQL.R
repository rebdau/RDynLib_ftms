#' @title Local networks for a selected COMPID 
#'
#' @description the Overall.net_SQL() function plots the CSPP or GNPS-like 
#' local networks, it iterates through the net.addit() and Local.net_SQL()
#' functions. The net.addit() function is responsible for generating lists 
#' of network nodes and edges by the net.nodes() and either the allCSPP() or 
#' allGNPS() functions, respectively. This generates the nodes and edges for 
#' the experiment-based global network. Only edges are retained that pass 
#' certain CID spectral similarity thresholds. The Local.net_SQL() function will 
#' select those nodes and edges belonging to the local network of the selected
#'COMPID and display the network graph.
#' 
#' @param sql_path 'character(1)' path to the sqlite database.
#' 
#' @param exp.id 'number(1)' experiment to use for network generation.
#' 
#' @param dbkey 'number(1)' compound_id, serving as the starting point of the 
#' molecular networking.Only nodes and edges connected to this COMPID within 
#' the specified number of sequential connections (`nr_of_seq`) are included 
#' in the displayed CSPP and GNPS local networks.
#' 
#' @param min numeric(1) Minimum intensity for the spectra. 
#' For instruments with high sensitivity, a value like 5 can be used, whereas  
#' for instruments with lower sensitivity, a value like 100 may be appropriate.
#' 
#' @param nr_of_seq 'number(1)' size of local network, i.e., number of 
#' subsequent edges starting from the node representing the selected COMPID.
#' 
#' @param thr1 'number(1)' minimum number of product ions (varying between 0 
#' and 1) of one CID spectrum that can be traced in another CID spectrum,
#' set on 1 by default.
#' 
#' @param thr2 'number(1)' dot product threshold for the common ions 
#' between two CID spectra, set on 0.9 by default.
#' 
#' @param thr3 'number(1)' average of the dot products obtained for the common 
#' product ions and the common neutral losses, by default set on 0.4.
#' 
#' @return returns a list of the cspp and gnps-like information and plots 
#'         the final network of the given compound_id in a given experiment.
